## 2.2 Sweet and sticky chicken wings

Serves: 4

Cooking time: 45 min

### 2.2 Ingredients

    900 g chicken wings
    60 ml coconut aminos
    2 tbsp tamari soy sauce
    ¼ tsp ground ginger
    ¼ tsp onion powder
    ¼ tsp garlic powder
    ¼ tsp chili flakes

### 2.2 Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F (225°C).
2. Place the wings with the thicker skin-side up on a rimmed baking sheet with wire racks. (The wire rack helps promote even cooking).
3. Bake the wings for 35 minutes.
4. When the wings have about 12 minutes left to bake, start making the sauce.
5. Heat a medium to a large skillet over medium heat, and add the coconut aminos, soy sauce, and seasoning.
6. Once the sauce comes to a simmer, begin stirring. Continue to stir periodically, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer.
7. Once the sauce has thickened slightly—as you stir it, it should take a few seconds for the sauce to fill back behind your spoon or spatula—you can turn off the heat while the wings finish cooking.
8. Place the wings in a large heatproof bowl and pour the sauce over them. Stir to evenly coat with the sauce, and serve.
